     <p class="subtitle">1800s: The passing of the 15th Amendment ensured that people could not be denied the right to vote

      based on race; half a million black men

      were now eligible to vote. However,

      the Southern States placed polling taxes

      and literacy tests to discourage Black men from

      excersing their right to vote. In 1869,
      Jim Crow Laws were established, enforcing segregation in the South.

<h3> Voter Suppression by the Numbers</h3>
<div class="effectscontainer">


<div class="onecontainer">
<p class="info"> In 2011, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach championed a law requiring Kansans to show “proof of citizenship” documents in order to register to vote. Most people don’t carry the required documents on hand — like a passport, or a birth certificate — and as a result, the law blocked over 30,000 Kansans from voting.</p>

<div class="twocontainer">
<p class="info"> In 2016, Arkansas purged thousands of voters for so-called felony convictions, even though some of the voters had never been convicted of a felony at all </p>

  <div class="effectscontainer">


  <div class="onecontainer">
  <p class="info"> In 2013, Virginia purged 39,000 voters based on data that was later found to have an error rate of up to 17 percent.
</p>

  </div>

  <div class="twocontainer">
  <p class="info"> A Brennan Center report found that “Latino voters waited almost 46 percent longer than white voters, and Black voters waited 45 percent longer on average.”108 This may mean that a greater percentage of Black voters are subjected to long lines, as the Pew Research Center found in November 2020 that only 38 percent of Black voters “say they voted by mail, compared with 45% of white voters.”109 </p>
